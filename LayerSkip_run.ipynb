The state police attributed the violence to greed and fear at the casinos.

The parties agreed that the employment would be on an at-will basis. At the end of her first week of work, the employee was given a booklet entitled \"Employment Manual,\" with instructions to read the book in its entirety by the end of the following week. That evening, the employee began reading the manual. The first few pages described the history of the company and provided a personal biography of its president. On page 20, the manual stated that the company treats its employees \"as family\" and that employees will be discharged \"only with good cause. \" The employee finished reading the manual as requested. The employee interpreted the statement on page 20 as insuring continued employment unless good cause existed for termination. Over the next two months, the employee continually complained to her supervisor that the lighting in the accounting department was insufficient. Finally the supervisor, fed up with the complaints, fired the employee. The employee then sued the company, seeking to recover on grounds of promissory estoppel.

The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military . . . was relaxed . . . ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.\n",

Although the painting was insured for $1,000,000 by an insurance company, it had a market value of over $1,500,000. When the woman returned from vacation, she met with a detective employed by the insurance company to investigate the theft. During their meeting, the woman told the detective that she would pay him an extra $50,000 if he recovered the paihting. For the next three weeks, the detective investigated the theft as part of his job responsibilities with the insurance company. Within the course of this investigation, the detective learned who was responsible for the burglary. As a consequence, the culprit was apprehended, and the painting was recovered and returned to the woman. The detective then requested the $50,000 that the woman had promised to pay him.

            "\"Wherever I go—the street, the shop, the house, or the steamboat—I hear the people talk in such a way as to indicate that they are yet unable to conceive of the Negro as possessing any rights at all. Men who are honorable in their dealings with their white neighbors will cheat a Negro without feeling a single twinge of their honor. To kill a Negro they do not deem murder; to debauch a Negro woman they do not think fornication; to take the property away from a Negro they do not consider robbery. The people boast that when they get freedmen affairs in their own hands, to use their own classic expression, 'the niggers will catch hell.'\n",
            "\"The reason of all this is simple and manifest. The whites esteem the blacks their property by natural right, and however much they may admit that the individual relations of masters and slaves have been destroyed by the war and the President's emancipation proclamation, they still have an ingrained feeling that the blacks at large belong to the whites at large, and whenever opportunity serves they treat the colored people just as their profit, caprice or passion may dictate.\"\n",

            "Input: Question: A man was prosecuted for the alleged murder of his estranged wife. At trial, the government was allowed to present the testimony of several women who testified to having flirtatious or sexual encounters with the defendant over the past 20 years prior to the homicide. None of the testimony showed any such activity within three years of the murder date, and none of it showed any violent tendencies of the defendant or intentions expressed that he wanted to kill his wife. The defendant had an alibi for the time of the crime and presented many alibi witnesses. The government claimed that it was showing motive by proving the defendant's proclivity for extra-marital affairs over the years and therefore his bad relationship with his wife. The jury convicted him after hearing the testimony of 10 women regarding defendant's various sexual contacts with them over prior years. The defendant appealed the murder conviction, claiming that the women's testimony was prejudicial and inflammatory and showed only bad character, which is not admissible under evidentiary rules. Will the appeals court likely reverse the conviction and order a new trial?\n",
            "A. Yes, the trial was unfair in presenting testimony of women going back over 20 years; it would have been proper to admit such testimony only as to the five years preceding the crime.\n",
            "B. Yes, the defendant did not receive a fair trial; the testimony of the women only showed his bad character but because they were old incidents and not continuing, they did not allow a permissible inference that these affairs gave him a motive to kill his spouse.\n",
            "C. No, if the testimony was admitted in error it was harmless error that did not sway the jury one way or another and so the defendant got a fair trial in all other respects.\n",
            "D. No, the testimony was admissible because it tended to show a pattern of \"transferred intent\" that proved the defendant's great hostility to his wife, and his need to eliminate her from his life so that he could go back to having a wild life.\n",

Above all, since they sometimes follow and sometimes precede Jupiter by the same intervals, and they remain within very limited distances either to east or west of Jupiter, accompanying that planet in both its retrograde and direct movements in a constant manner, no one can doubt that they complete their revolutions about Jupiter and at the same time effect all together a twelve-year period about the center of the universe.\n",

            "A. The distinction between limited force and full-scale force is the second process of coercive diplomacy. Coercive diplomacy only fails if the coercer fails to achieve its defined goals and fails to defeat its adversary in the second stage.\n",
            "B. Generally the distinction between brute and limited force is negligible. Resort to air or sea power constitutes an equal coercive capacity to a conventional ground offensive. Military action always results from a failure of negotiations and from a shift from the diplomatic to the military sphere.\n",
            "C. The distinction between limited force and brute force is important because the amount of force that is used to attain the coercer's interests defines the type of outcome that is achieved. If a positive policy outcome is achieved, then we can say that limited force has been employed.\n",
            "D. The distinction between limited force and full-scale war is crucial because resort to brute force means that diplomacy has failed. The distinction is not based on the amount of force or the type, but on the purpose that the use of force seeks to accomplish and the element of choice left to the adversary. In essence, limited force is a bargaining tool.\n",

That night I slept peacefully for the first time in many weeks.\n",

However, it was not until midnight that I fell asleep. The next day, when I got the test, it might as well have been written in Serbian (which I don't know how to read). I tried my best to work out the hard problems, but the numbers I came up with were strange.

I was attracted to look over at his test, but then the many bad results I had heard about cheating   came into my mind. I reasoned that if I started cheating now, it would be hard to give up that habit during high school. In the end, I decided not to copy his answers, and got a B- on that test.

            "Article: A recent study offers a picture of how dangerous it is to get a lift from a teenage driver. Indeed, a 16-year-old driver with three or more passengers is three times as likely to have a fatal accident as a teenager driving alone. However, the possibility of death for drivers between 30 and 59 decreases with each additional (added) passenger.\n",
            "It was also found that the death rates for teenage drivers increased greatly after 10 p.m., and especially after midnight. With passengers in the car, the driver was even more likely to die in a late night accident.\n",
            "Robert Foss, a scientist at the University of North Carolina Highway Safety Research Center, says the higher death rates for teenage drivers have less to do with \"really stupid behavior\" than with just a lack of driving experience. Both he and the author of the study believe that the way to help solve the problem is to have states setting up so-called graduated licensing systems .

Allison realized that she spent her years finding her way: time well spent, and time we must all take if  we're being honest with ourselves. The only way to lead an interesting life is to face uncertainty and make a choice. Otherwise your life is not your own - it is a path someone else has chosen.

            "As the key transportation link at joint place of the Great Canal ( Beijing-Hangzhou) and Changjiang (Yangtze River), Yangzhou has been from the Sui Dynasty (600 AD.) an economically rich city, and then reached its top in the Tang Dynasty. At that time Yangzhou was a famous port and one of few biggest cities in East Asia.\n",
            "With the improvement of the local economy and easy transportation way, there happened in the history a special local culture, which has an important place in Chinese culture. Many famous men of letters, poets, artists, scholars , statesmen, scientists and national heroes in the history were born in, lived in or had connection with Yangzhou. Li Bai, one of the greatest Chinese poets visited and stayed in Yangzhou several times in his life and one of his famous poems about Yangzhou has been so popular that Chinese of all ages can sing it and has become a symbol of Yangzhou . Zheng Banqiao, a famous Chinese painting painter in the Qing Dynasty heading a group called \"Eight Eccentrics\", had strongly influenced Chinese paintings. Wang Zhong and Yuan Yuan and some other scholars formed school of Yangzhou Scholars and achieved great success in the study of classic Chinese and writing. Zhu Ziqing, one of most famous modern Chinese writers and scholars, had always been proud of himself as a native of Yangzhou and thanked the city for being nourished  by its rich culture. Quite a few other names you may come across frequently in the study of Chinese culture and history have connection with Yangzhou . Yangzhou was so attractive and important that many Chinese emperors in history had come specially to visit or check the city. Emperor Suiyang, who ordered to cut the Great Canal so that he could come more easily and quickly, died on his last trip to the city and buried  here. Emperor Qianlong had come all the way from the north and visited the city nine times.\n",

            "Article: As kids, we learn how to write, maybe play a musical instrument and draw. So why don't we learn to code   computer programs too? What coding has in common with writing, playing music and creating art is that it lets you bring your ideas to life. Coding is all about creativity and music and creating art Crearbing with code CoderDojo helps young perople around the world to learn computer  programming for free. When I went to my first CoderDojo class in Dublin City University in Ireland, at age nine, I didn't know anything about coding or even what it was. But I remember making my very first web page that first day, and being surprised that I could create such a thing. It was a great feeling that I think every young person should experience!\n",
            "By going to CoderDojo every week, I learned how to make websites, apps and games. One of my apps is called Auto-Journalist. It can help journalists   and interwewees do interviews even if they are both really busy or live in different time zones. It is still in development, and I have showed it at an event called Coolest Projects Awards, where young people get to show the public what they have created with code. It's so mucbt fun to share one's creations, and to see what everyone else has made too.\n",
            "Learnuing environment\n",
            "For the past three years I have also been helping to teach other young people at CoderDojo DCU. In recent years I have also noticed many more girls attending CoderDojo DCU to try out coding. This has a lot to do with the CoderDojo girls' classes -- girls and young women take part in it with their friends, and it doesn't feel like coding is a \"boy thing\". It is really wonderful to see this, because we need more girls and women in STEM ( Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths). It's a good way to leam more about technology.\n",
            "Start early\n",
            "One of the main things I have leamed in the last few years is that coding is not only for adults, coding is for young people, too. And when you are a child it is a great time to start coding, because your imagination is the limit for what you can create !\n",

            "Input: Question: A state built a casino and issued bonds to finance its construction. On five occasions, there were episodes of violence in various casinos in the state. The state police attributed the violence to greed and fear at the casinos. To prevent such violence, the state legislature passes a statute prohibiting all gambling at privately owned casinos in the state. Is this law likely to be held constitutional if most casinos in the state were owned by those from out-of-state?\n",
            "A. Yes, because the act was expressly authorized by the state legislature.\n",
            "B. Yes, but only if the local interest in safety outweighs the burden of interstate commerce.\n",
            "C. No, because out-of-state casinos are part of interstate commerce.\n",
            "D. No, because the statute violates the due process rights of the owners of the casinos.\n",

            "Input: Question: After a lengthy interview with a company vice president, an employee was hired by the company to work in the company's accounting department. The parties agreed that the employment would be on an at-will basis. At the end of her first week of work, the employee was given a booklet entitled \"Employment Manual,\" with instructions to read the book in its entirety by the end of the following week. That evening, the employee began reading the manual. The first few pages described the history of the company and provided a personal biography of its president. On page 20, the manual stated that the company treats its employees \"as family\" and that employees will be discharged \"only with good cause. \" The employee finished reading the manual as requested. The employee interpreted the statement on page 20 as insuring continued employment unless good cause existed for termination. Over the next two months, the employee continually complained to her supervisor that the lighting in the accounting department was insufficient. Finally the supervisor, fed up with the complaints, fired the employee. The employee then sued the company, seeking to recover on grounds of promissory estoppel.

The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military . . . was relaxed . . . ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.\n",

Although the painting was insured for $1,000,000 by an insurance company, it had a market value of over $1,500,000. When the woman returned from vacation, she met with a detective employed by the insurance company to investigate the theft. During their meeting, the woman told the detective that she would pay him an extra $50,000 if he recovered the paihting. For the next three weeks, the detective investigated the theft as part of his job responsibilities with the insurance company. Within the course of this investigation, the detective learned who was responsible for the burglary. As a consequence, the culprit was apprehended, and the painting was recovered and returned to the woman. The detective then requested the $50,000 that the woman had promised to pay him. After the woman refused to make the payment, the detective sued the woman for breach of contract. Who is most likely to prevail?\n",

When the driver could not produce a driver's license, the officer asked him if he minded if they searched the vehicle. The officer did not advise the driver that he had a right to refuse consent or that if he refused his decision would be honored, but there was nothing duplicitous or coercive in the officer's conduct. The driver smiled and said \"of course, no problem.\" The officer found stolen bank checks under the rear seat. In a later suppression motion, the driver claimed that his consent was not voluntary. What will the court most likely decide on that issue?\n",

His maternal grandfather was an imperial commander, Yin Kaishan. His father Chen Guangrui had come top in the Palace Examination and had been appointed a grand secretary in the Imperial Library. Xuanzang, however, had no interest in honour and glory, and his only joy was to cultivate Nirvana. His virtue was great; of the thousand sutras and ten thousand holy books there was not a single one that he did not know.\n",

If I am not fated to have a disciple, and this monkey is an evil monster who has deceived me and will do me no good, then may I be unable to remove the seal.\" When he had prayed he bowed again.\n",

            "Input: Question: A man was prosecuted for the alleged murder of his estranged wife. At trial, the government was allowed to present the testimony of several women who testified to having flirtatious or sexual encounters with the defendant over the past 20 years prior to the homicide. None of the testimony showed any such activity within three years of the murder date, and none of it showed any violent tendencies of the defendant or intentions expressed that he wanted to kill his wife. The defendant had an alibi for the time of the crime and presented many alibi witnesses. The government claimed that it was showing motive by proving the defendant's proclivity for extra-marital affairs over the years and therefore his bad relationship with his wife. The jury convicted him after hearing the testimony of 10 women regarding defendant's various sexual contacts with them over prior years. The defendant appealed the murder conviction, claiming that the women's testimony was prejudicial and inflammatory and showed only bad character, which is not admissible under evidentiary rules. Will the appeals court likely reverse the conviction and order a new trial?\n",
            "A. Yes, the trial was unfair in presenting testimony of women going back over 20 years; it would have been proper to admit such testimony only as to the five years preceding the crime.\n",
            "B. Yes, the defendant did not receive a fair trial; the testimony of the women only showed his bad character but because they were old incidents and not continuing, they did not allow a permissible inference that these affairs gave him a motive to kill his spouse.\n",
            "C. No, if the testimony was admitted in error it was harmless error that did not sway the jury one way or another and so the defendant got a fair trial in all other respects.\n",
            "D. No, the testimony was admissible because it tended to show a pattern of \"transferred intent\" that proved the defendant's great hostility to his wife, and his need to eliminate her from his life so that he could go back to having a wild life.\n",

Nor were there just three such stars; four wanderers complete their revolutions about Jupiter, and of their alterations as observed more precisely later on we shall give a description here. Also I measured the distances between them by means of the telescope. . . .\n",
            "Such are the observations concerning the four Medicean planets recently first discovered by me, and although from this data their periods have not yet been reconstructed in numerical form, it is legitimate at least to put in evidence some facts worthy of note. Above all, since they sometimes follow and sometimes precede Jupiter by the same intervals, and they remain within very limited distances either to east or west of Jupiter, accompanying that planet in both its retrograde and direct movements in a constant manner, no one can doubt that they complete their revolutions about Jupiter and at the same time effect all together a twelve-year period about the center of the universe.\n",

            "A. The distinction between limited force and full-scale force is the second process of coercive diplomacy. Coercive diplomacy only fails if the coercer fails to achieve its defined goals and fails to defeat its adversary in the second stage.\n",
            "B. Generally the distinction between brute and limited force is negligible. Resort to air or sea power constitutes an equal coercive capacity to a conventional ground offensive. Military action always results from a failure of negotiations and from a shift from the diplomatic to the military sphere.\n",
            "C. The distinction between limited force and brute force is important because the amount of force that is used to attain the coercer's interests defines the type of outcome that is achieved. If a positive policy outcome is achieved, then we can say that limited force has been employed.\n",
            "D. The distinction between limited force and full-scale war is crucial because resort to brute force means that diplomacy has failed. The distinction is not based on the amount of force or the type, but on the purpose that the use of force seeks to accomplish and the element of choice left to the adversary. In essence, limited force is a bargaining tool.\n",

As the air in the earth's atmosphere is moving all the time, the light from the stars looks as if it is moving too.\n",

A telescope   was sent into space so that the air movements in the atmosphere could be avoided  . It took a long time to build the space telescope but finally in 1990, a huge space telescope called the Hubble Space Telescope was successfully sent into space. Since then, astronomers have many important observations that have helped people understand space better.\n",

And it's used in many countries. The number on each book tells you exactly what kind of book it is. This system is also useful for knowing where to go in the library to find a book.\n",
            "In this system, there are ten large groups of books. Each of these groups has its own number, such as 100, 200, etc. So, for example, any books about language will have a number 400. On the other hand, any books about history will have a number 900. So, a number in the hundreds place tells you what general group a book is in. If you find a book that has a number in the 500s, you know it is a book about science.\n",
            "However, science is a big group, so the tens place is used to make a more detailed set of science books. For example, math books are included in the group of science books.

They told him that there was no food. The traveller explained that he didn't need any food and that, in fact, he was planning to make a soup to share with them instead. The villagers watched suspiciously as he built a fire and filled a pot with water With great ceremony , he pulled a stone from a bag, and dropped the stone into the pot of water. After a moment, he smelt the soup and shouted with excitement, \"How delicious the soup is!\" As the villagers began to show interest, he mentioned how good the soup would be with just a little cabbage in it. A villager brought out a cabbage to share. This episode  repeated itself until the soup had cabbage, carrots, onions, and beets--indeed, a full pot of soup that could feed everyone in the village was ready. This story describes when there are not enough resources , humans will store things. We do not want to share. The story of stone soup helps us realize that, in doing so, we often prevent ourselves and everyone else from having a feast .The meaning of this story goes far beyond food. We keep to ourselves ideas, love, and energy, thinking we will be richer, but in fact we make the world, and ourselves, poorer. The traveller was able to see that the villagers were holding back, and he had the ability to inspire  them to give. In this way, they created a large meal that none of them could have created alone. Are you like one of the villagers? If you come forward and share your gifts, you will inspire others to do the same. The reward is a feast that can feed many.\n",

            "Back in 1872, people didn't know exactly whether all four of a horse's hooves   left the ground at the same time when it was running. A gentleman called Leland Stanford made a bet with his friend about it. Most people believed that a horse always had one hoof on the ground, or it would fall over. But Stanford didn't think so.\n",
            "At that time, it was hard to know who could win the bet, because a horse's legs move so fast that it is impossible to tell just by looking. So they needed a way to record the movement of a running horse. Then Stanford offered $25,000 to the famous photographer, Muybridge, to help find the answer. In the beginning, Muybridge failed to get clear images, but he didn't give up. He continued to improve his cameras. In 1878, after many experiments, he managed to get a sequence   of 12 photos. One of them clearly showed that all four of the horse's hooves were off the ground at the same time. And when the photos moved fast, people could see a horse running.\n",

            "Input: Article: Music education hasn't changed much since the 1970s. Students are still taught to read notation so they can recite compositions that they would never listen to on their MP3 players or play with friends. Playing music enriches life. The question is: Why do schools teach music in a way that _ so many young people rather than catch their imagination? Can we do a better job of using the power of music to get kids excited about school?\n",
            "The experience of an organization called Little Kids Rock suggests the answer is yes -- if we change the way music is taught. Little Kids Rock has helped music programs in over a thousand public schools and served 150,000 children. The organization has given 30,000 free instruments out, mainly guitars, and trained 1,500 teachers to run music classes in which students quickly experience the joys of playing their favorite songs, performing in bands , and writing their own music.\n",
            "The key to Little Kids Rock is that it teaches children to play music the way many musicians learn to play it -- not by notation, but by listening, imitation and meaningful experimentation. \"The knowledge you need to get started playing rock music is very limited,\" explains Dave Wish, the founder of Little Kids Rock. \"In high school, my friend Paul taught me a couple of chords and my life was changed forever. On the first day of class, Little Kids Rock teachers place guitars in the hands of their students and get them practicing chords that will enable them to play thousands of songs. The kids decide what songs they want to learn and the class is off and running. Their progress is surprising. Within a year, eight and nine-year-olds are playing musical instruments, and giving concerts, even performing their own songs.\n",
            "One of the biggest advantages that music offers is the ability to encourage students who are otherwise bored by school. \"I've had students start coming back to school because of this program,\" said Adkison Thomas, who heads up music for the Dallas Independent School District. He added, \"One of the best things is that the teachers discover a new side of their students. They see kids become successful who weren't before.\"\n",

            "Scientists from American University looked at the eating behavior of 54 kids between the ages of 2 and 6. At snack time, the scientist watched the amount of food each child ate while they were in groups of either three or nine.

Those in the larger group ate nearly 30 percent more than those in the smaller group, and they actually ate faster.\n",

They told him that there was no food. The traveller explained that he didn't need any food and that, in fact, he was planning to make a soup to share with them instead. The villagers watched suspiciously as he built a fire and filled a pot with water With great ceremony , he pulled a stone from a bag, and dropped the stone into the pot of water. After a moment, he smelt the soup and shouted with excitement, \"How delicious the soup is!\" As the villagers began to show interest, he mentioned how good the soup would be with just a little cabbage in it. A villager brought out a cabbage to share. This episode  repeated itself until the soup had cabbage, carrots, onions, and beets--indeed, a full pot of soup that could feed everyone in the village was ready. This story describes when there are not enough resources , humans will store things. We do not want to share. The story of stone soup helps us realize that, in doing so, we often prevent ourselves and everyone else from having a feast .The meaning of this story goes far beyond food. We keep to ourselves ideas, love, and energy, thinking we will be richer, but in fact we make the world, and ourselves, poorer. The traveller was able to see that the villagers were holding back, and he had the ability to inspire  them to give. In this way, they created a large meal that none of them could have created alone.

When we arrived, we discovered that the family we were going to help was living in a trailer that was in poor condition, no bigger than two parking spaces. A group of people had been working on it for two weeks, but every time they finished one problem, another appeared.\n",
            "We soon decided that the only way was to build a new house. It was something unusual because normally our goal was to repair old homes. The family was pleased with their new house that was 20 by 30 feet with three bedrooms, a bath and a kitchen.\n",
            "On Tuesday of that week, I asked the family's three boys, Josh, Eric and Ryan, \"What do you want for your new room?\" Kids in the families we had helped usually wanted toys or posters, so we were surprised when Josh, the oldest boy said, \"We just want beds.\" The boys had never slept in a bed. That night we had a meeting and decided that beds would be the perfect gift. On Thursday night, a few adults in our group drove to the nearest city and bought beds and new bedding.\n",

So scientists were trying hard to find ways to make pictures that can move. They made lots of experiments, but failed again and again. It was Eadweard Muybridge who finally succeeded. He was the first photographer to try this successfully. But how did he make it? It was an interesting story.\n",
            "Back in 1872, people didn't know exactly whether all four of a horse's hooves   left the ground at the same time when it was running. A gentleman called Leland Stanford made a bet with his friend about it. Most people believed that a horse always had one hoof on the ground, or it would fall over. But Stanford didn't think so.\n",
            "At that time, it was hard to know who could win the bet, because a horse's legs move so fast that it is impossible to tell just by looking. So they needed a way to record the movement of a running horse. Then Stanford offered $25,000 to the famous photographer, Muybridge, to help find the answer. In the beginning, Muybridge failed to get clear images, but he didn't give up. He continued to improve his cameras. In 1878, after many experiments, he managed to get a sequence   of 12 photos. One of them clearly showed that all four of the horse's hooves were off the ground at the same time. And when the photos moved fast, people could see a horse running.\n",

Students are still taught to read notation so they can recite compositions that they would never listen to on their MP3 players or play with friends. Playing music enriches life. The question is: Why do schools teach music in a way that _ so many young people rather than catch their imagination? Can we do a better job of using the power of music to get kids excited about school?\n",
            "The experience of an organization called Little Kids Rock suggests the answer is yes -- if we change the way music is taught. Little Kids Rock has helped music programs in over a thousand public schools and served 150,000 children. The organization has given 30,000 free instruments out, mainly guitars, and trained 1,500 teachers to run music classes in which students quickly experience the joys of playing their favorite songs, performing in bands , and writing their own music.\n",
            "The key to Little Kids Rock is that it teaches children to play music the way many musicians learn to play it -- not by notation, but by listening, imitation and meaningful experimentation. \"The knowledge you need to get started playing rock music is very limited,\" explains Dave Wish, the founder of Little Kids Rock. \"In high school, my friend Paul taught me a couple of chords and my life was changed forever. On the first day of class, Little Kids Rock teachers place guitars in the hands of their students and get them practicing chords that will enable them to play thousands of songs. The kids decide what songs they want to learn and the class is off and running. Their progress is surprising. Within a year, eight and nine-year-olds are playing musical instruments, and giving concerts, even performing their own songs.\n",
            "One of the biggest advantages that music offers is the ability to encourage students who are otherwise bored by school. \"I've had students start coming back to school because of this program,\" said Adkison Thomas, who heads up music for the Dallas Independent School District.

It took a long time to build the space telescope but finally in 1990, a huge space telescope called the Hubble Space Telescope was successfully sent into space. Since then, astronomers have many important observations that have helped people understand space better.\n",

Some days ago, Xiao Baiyou's latest book about how to be a successful parent came out. He is pretty strict with his four children. Sometimes he even beat them. But the children don't hate their daddy at all. And all of them finally went to Pecking University, one of the top universities in China. So Xiao proudly tells others about his education idea that children need strict rules. In his microblog, he said, \"Come on, want your children to enter Peking University without rules? You must be joking.\" And, \"Leave your children more money, and strict rules at the same time.\"But the \"Wolf Daddy\" way was soon questioned by other parents. Some say that Xiao Baiyou just want to be famous by doing so. The \"Wolf Daddy\" Xiao Baiyou is a 47-year-old Guangdong businessman who deals in luxury goods  in Hong Kong. Unlike many other parents who usually have one child, Xiao has four children. Two of them were born in Hong Kong and two in the US.

            "Input: Article: Once a traveller came into a village which was suffering from hunger. The villagers asked him to leave, for they feared he wanted them to give him food. They told him that there was no food. The traveller explained that he didn't need any food and that, in fact, he was planning to make a soup to share with them instead. The villagers watched suspiciously as he built a fire and filled a pot with water With great ceremony , he pulled a stone from a bag, and dropped the stone into the pot of water. After a moment, he smelt the soup and shouted with excitement, \"How delicious the soup is!\" As the villagers began to show interest, he mentioned how good the soup would be with just a little cabbage in it. A villager brought out a cabbage to share. This episode  repeated itself until the soup had cabbage, carrots, onions, and beets--indeed, a full pot of soup that could feed everyone in the village was ready. This story describes when there are not enough resources , humans will store things. We do not want to share. The story of stone soup helps us realize that, in doing so, we often prevent ourselves and everyone else from having a feast .The meaning of this story goes far beyond food. We keep to ourselves ideas, love, and energy, thinking we will be richer, but in fact we make the world, and ourselves, poorer. The traveller was able to see that the villagers were holding back, and he had the ability to inspire  them to give. In this way, they created a large meal that none of them could have created alone. Are you like one of the villagers? If you come forward and share your gifts, you will inspire others to do the same. The reward is a feast that can feed many.\n",

There are more countries where people seem to be living nearly _ each other because conditions are overcrowded . Then there are others where it seems that hardly anybody lives. What influences this unequal distribution of people ? There are specific advantages and disadvantages of living in a certain area.\n",

Areas that have bad weather are generally less ideal as places to live in .

When it comes to climates, warm conditions and a normal amount of rainfall are advantages that attract people.\n",

When we arrived, we discovered that the family we were going to help was living in a trailer that was in poor condition, no bigger than two parking spaces. A group of people had been working on it for two weeks, but every time they finished one problem, another appeared.\n",

That night we had a meeting and decided that beds would be the perfect gift. On Thursday night, a few adults in our group drove to the nearest city and bought beds and new bedding.\n",

            "That afternoon, while we were setting up the beds, Eric ran into the house to watch us with wide eyes. As Maggie, a member of our group, put one of the pillows on the bed, Eric asked, \"What is that?\"\n",

            "Input: Article: The word, \"photography\", was first used in 1839. It comes from the Greek words that mean \"to write with light\". But photography could only give people _ pictures. So scientists were trying hard to find ways to make pictures that can move. They made lots of experiments, but failed again and again. It was Eadweard Muybridge who finally succeeded. He was the first photographer to try this successfully. But how did he make it? It was an interesting story.\n",
            "Back in 1872, people didn't know exactly whether all four of a horse's hooves   left the ground at the same time when it was running. A gentleman called Leland Stanford made a bet with his friend about it. Most people believed that a horse always had one hoof on the ground, or it would fall over. But Stanford didn't think so.\n",
            "At that time, it was hard to know who could win the bet, because a horse's legs move so fast that it is impossible to tell just by looking. So they needed a way to record the movement of a running horse. Then Stanford offered $25,000 to the famous photographer, Muybridge, to help find the answer. In the beginning, Muybridge failed to get clear images, but he didn't give up. He continued to improve his cameras. In 1878, after many experiments, he managed to get a sequence   of 12 photos. One of them clearly showed that all four of the horse's hooves were off the ground at the same time. And when the photos moved fast, people could see a horse running.\n",

            "Input: Article: Music education hasn't changed much since the 1970s. Students are still taught to read notation so they can recite compositions that they would never listen to on their MP3 players or play with friends. Playing music enriches life. The question is: Why do schools teach music in a way that _ so many young people rather than catch their imagination? Can we do a better job of using the power of music to get kids excited about school?\n",
            "The experience of an organization called Little Kids Rock suggests the answer is yes -- if we change the way music is taught. Little Kids Rock has helped music programs in over a thousand public schools and served 150,000 children. The organization has given 30,000 free instruments out, mainly guitars, and trained 1,500 teachers to run music classes in which students quickly experience the joys of playing their favorite songs, performing in bands , and writing their own music.\n",
            "The key to Little Kids Rock is that it teaches children to play music the way many musicians learn to play it -- not by notation, but by listening, imitation and meaningful experimentation. \"The knowledge you need to get started playing rock music is very limited,\" explains Dave Wish, the founder of Little Kids Rock. \"In high school, my friend Paul taught me a couple of chords and my life was changed forever. On the first day of class, Little Kids Rock teachers place guitars in the hands of their students and get them practicing chords that will enable them to play thousands of songs. The kids decide what songs they want to learn and the class is off and running. Their progress is surprising. Within a year, eight and nine-year-olds are playing musical instruments, and giving concerts, even performing their own songs.\n",
            "One of the biggest advantages that music offers is the ability to encourage students who are otherwise bored by school. \"I've had students start coming back to school because of this program,\" said Adkison Thomas, who heads up music for the Dallas Independent School District. He added, \"One of the best things is that the teachers discover a new side of their students. They see kids become successful who weren't before.\"\n",

At snack time, the scientist watched the amount of food each child ate while they were in groups of either three or nine.

Some days ago, Xiao Baiyou's latest book about how to be a successful parent came out. He is pretty strict with his four children. Sometimes he even beat them. But the children don't hate their daddy at all. And all of them finally went to Pecking University, one of the top universities in China. So Xiao proudly tells others about his education idea that children need strict rules. In his microblog, he said, \"Come on, want your children to enter Peking University without rules? You must be joking.\" And, \"Leave your children more money, and strict rules at the same time.\"But the \"Wolf Daddy\" way was soon questioned by other parents. Some say that Xiao Baiyou just want to be famous by doing so. The \"Wolf Daddy\" Xiao Baiyou is a 47-year-old Guangdong businessman who deals in luxury goods  in Hong Kong. Unlike many other parents who usually have one child, Xiao has four children. Two of them were born in Hong Kong and two in the US. Some people on the Internet think the reason why his children were able to enter Peking University is because the exam is much easier taken from Hong Kong.\n",

            "Input: Article: Once a traveller came into a village which was suffering from hunger. The villagers asked him to leave, for they feared he wanted them to give him food. They told him that there was no food. The traveller explained that he didn't need any food and that, in fact, he was planning to make a soup to share with them instead. The villagers watched suspiciously as he built a fire and filled a pot with water With great ceremony , he pulled a stone from a bag, and dropped the stone into the pot of water. After a moment, he smelt the soup and shouted with excitement, \"How delicious the soup is!\" As the villagers began to show interest, he mentioned how good the soup would be with just a little cabbage in it. A villager brought out a cabbage to share. This episode  repeated itself until the soup had cabbage, carrots, onions, and beets--indeed, a full pot of soup that could feed everyone in the village was ready. This story describes when there are not enough resources , humans will store things. We do not want to share. The story of stone soup helps us realize that, in doing so, we often prevent ourselves and everyone else from having a feast .The meaning of this story goes far beyond food. We keep to ourselves ideas, love, and energy, thinking we will be richer, but in fact we make the world, and ourselves, poorer. The traveller was able to see that the villagers were holding back, and he had the ability to inspire  them to give. In this way, they created a large meal that none of them could have created alone. Are you like one of the villagers? If you come forward and share your gifts, you will inspire others to do the same. The reward is a feast that can feed many.\n",

There are more countries where people seem to be living nearly _ each other because conditions are overcrowded . Then there are others where it seems that hardly anybody lives. What influences this unequal distribution of people ? There are specific advantages and disadvantages of living in a certain area.\n",
            "The two main factors   that influence people's choice of location are climate and resources. Climate is the usual weather conditions in a region. Areas that have bad weather are generally less ideal as places to live in . The north and south poles at the top and bottom of the world may be beautiful in their rugged, natural way , but the disadvantage of the bitterly cold and windy conditions usually keeps people away. When it comes to climates, warm conditions and a normal amount of rainfall are advantages that attract people.\n",
            "Natural resources are tings that we get from nature that help us survive. Each region offers different resources, and therefore attracts different groups of people. People who enjoy the beach can make their living by catching and selling the ocean's many fish and other sea creature. Those who prefer farming can take advantage of rich soil in valleys near rivers. Some people are willing to accept the disadvantages of the terrible conditions of deserts or mountains in order to take advantages of the resources like oil or woods.\n",

When we arrived, we discovered that the family we were going to help was living in a trailer that was in poor condition, no bigger than two parking spaces. A group of people had been working on it for two weeks, but every time they finished one problem, another appeared.\n",

That night we had a meeting and decided that beds would be the perfect gift. On Thursday night, a few adults in our group drove to the nearest city and bought beds and new bedding.\n",

            "Input: Article: The word, \"photography\", was first used in 1839. It comes from the Greek words that mean \"to write with light\". But photography could only give people _ pictures. So scientists were trying hard to find ways to make pictures that can move. They made lots of experiments, but failed again and again. It was Eadweard Muybridge who finally succeeded. He was the first photographer to try this successfully. But how did he make it? It was an interesting story.\n",
            "Back in 1872, people didn't know exactly whether all four of a horse's hooves   left the ground at the same time when it was running. A gentleman called Leland Stanford made a bet with his friend about it. Most people believed that a horse always had one hoof on the ground, or it would fall over. But Stanford didn't think so.\n",
            "At that time, it was hard to know who could win the bet, because a horse's legs move so fast that it is impossible to tell just by looking. So they needed a way to record the movement of a running horse. Then Stanford offered $25,000 to the famous photographer, Muybridge, to help find the answer. In the beginning, Muybridge failed to get clear images, but he didn't give up. He continued to improve his cameras. In 1878, after many experiments, he managed to get a sequence   of 12 photos. One of them clearly showed that all four of the horse's hooves were off the ground at the same time. And when the photos moved fast, people could see a horse running.\n",

            "Input: Article: Music education hasn't changed much since the 1970s. Students are still taught to read notation so they can recite compositions that they would never listen to on their MP3 players or play with friends. Playing music enriches life. The question is: Why do schools teach music in a way that _ so many young people rather than catch their imagination? Can we do a better job of using the power of music to get kids excited about school?\n",
            "The experience of an organization called Little Kids Rock suggests the answer is yes -- if we change the way music is taught. Little Kids Rock has helped music programs in over a thousand public schools and served 150,000 children. The organization has given 30,000 free instruments out, mainly guitars, and trained 1,500 teachers to run music classes in which students quickly experience the joys of playing their favorite songs, performing in bands , and writing their own music.\n",
            "The key to Little Kids Rock is that it teaches children to play music the way many musicians learn to play it -- not by notation, but by listening, imitation and meaningful experimentation. \"The knowledge you need to get started playing rock music is very limited,\" explains Dave Wish, the founder of Little Kids Rock. \"In high school, my friend Paul taught me a couple of chords and my life was changed forever. On the first day of class, Little Kids Rock teachers place guitars in the hands of their students and get them practicing chords that will enable them to play thousands of songs. The kids decide what songs they want to learn and the class is off and running. Their progress is surprising. Within a year, eight and nine-year-olds are playing musical instruments, and giving concerts, even performing their own songs.\n",
            "One of the biggest advantages that music offers is the ability to encourage students who are otherwise bored by school. \"I've had students start coming back to school because of this program,\" said Adkison Thomas, who heads up music for the Dallas Independent School District. He added, \"One of the best things is that the teachers discover a new side of their students. They see kids become successful who weren't before.\"\n",
